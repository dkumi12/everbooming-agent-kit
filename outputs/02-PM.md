## 3. User Scenarios  

| Persona | Scenario | Desired Outcome | Pain Points Addressed |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Alex – Home‑Fit** | Alex logs into the app after a long workday. The AI suggests a 20‑minute HIIT routine that uses only bodyweight. He follows the AR video, tracks his heart rate, and earns a badge for consistency. | Quick, effective workout that fits his schedule. | Lack of accountability, limited equipment. |
| **Maria – Busy Exec** | Maria receives a push notification that her calendar has a 15‑minute slot. She pulls up a micro‑workout that can be done at her desk, syncs her Apple Watch for heart‑rate monitoring, and logs the session offline. | Efficient workout that fits travel and office life. | Time constraints, inconsistent routine. |
| **David – Rehab Coach** | David creates a custom rehab plan for a client with knee pain. The plan includes low‑impact cardio, strength exercises, and daily progress alerts. The client logs pain levels; the AI adjusts the plan accordingly. | Safe, progressive recovery program. | Manual client data, risk of re‑injury. |
| **Sofia – Trainer** | Sofia lists her services on the marketplace, sets a price, and schedules a session with a new client. The app automatically sends a progress report after the session and updates her calendar. | Scale client base, reduce admin time. | Scheduling, client progress tracking. |
| **Ethan – Community Enthusiast** | Ethan joins a 30‑day “Squat Challenge” with friends. He sees his rank on the leaderboard, shares his progress on Instagram, and receives a virtual badge. | Social motivation, competition. | Boring workouts, lack of social interaction. |
